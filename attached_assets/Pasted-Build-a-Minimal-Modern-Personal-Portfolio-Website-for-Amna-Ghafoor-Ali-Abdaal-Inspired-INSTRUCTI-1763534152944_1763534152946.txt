3. About Section

I’m Amna, a Computer Science graduate who fell in love with data science and AI somewhere between analyzing messy spreadsheets and training my first ML model. I’m especially interested in how data, automation, and intelligent systems can simplify work and support better decision-making.

I’ve interned at Kangroo Ventures and the National Incubation Center Faisalabad, where I worked on building recommendation systems, sentiment analysis pipelines, and startup research dashboards.

I enjoy learning fast, thinking analytically, and building practical AI-driven solutions.
